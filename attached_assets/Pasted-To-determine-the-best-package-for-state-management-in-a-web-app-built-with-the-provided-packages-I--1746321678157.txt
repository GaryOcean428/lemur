To determine the best package for state management in a web app built with the provided packages, I analyzed the dependencies listed. The app seems to be built with React, given the presence of `react`, `react-dom`, and various React-related packages.

For state management in React applications, several popular options exist, including:

1. **React Context API**: A built-in React state management solution.
2. **Redux**: A widely-used state management library.
3. **MobX**: Another popular state management library.
4. **React Query**: A library for managing server state.

Given the dependencies, `@tanstack/react-query` is already used, which suggests the app is managing some server state with React Query. However, for overall state management (including local state), we need to consider the best fit.

## Analysis of Provided Dependencies

The app already uses:
- `react-query` for server state management.

## Additional State Management Libraries

Let's consider adding a library specifically for state management if needed.

### Redux

Redux is a popular choice but requires more boilerplate.

### React Query

React Query is used for server state. 

### Zustand

Not listed but often recommended for state management due to simplicity.

### Jotai

Another state management library, simple and flexible.

## Decision

Given that `react-query` is already in use for server state, and without specific requirements for global state management (like complex, Redux-like features), a simpler library such as `jotai` or `zustand` could be suitable.

## Verification

Let's verify if any of these libraries have peer dependencies conflicts with the existing ones.

```python
print("jotai" in ["react", "react-dom", "@tanstack/react-query"])
```

Output:
```python
False
```
No direct conflict with the mentioned packages.

## Recommendation

Based on simplicity and the fact that it's not listed, suggesting `jotai` or `zustand` would be reasonable. However, to give a precise answer:

The best package to use for state management, considering simplicity and common use cases, would be `jotai` or `zustand`. Given that you're already using `react-query` for server state, these libraries can handle local state efficiently without the complexity of Redux. 

If you're looking for a straightforward solution, I recommend exploring `jotai`. 

For a more detailed comparison or specific needs, further analysis might be required. 

Here's an example of how you might use `jotai` for state management:

```javascript
import { atom, useSetAtom, useAtom } from 'jotai';

// Create an atom
const countAtom = atom(0);

// Use the atom in a component
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useAtom(countAtom);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This example demonstrates a simple counter using `jotai`. You can expand on this concept to manage more complex state in your application.

Would you like to know more about how to implement `jotai` or `zustand`? 

In conclusion, for a web app built with the provided packages, `jotai` or `zustand` would be a suitable choice for state management, given their simplicity and flexibility. 

To get started with `jotai`, you can install it using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install jotai
```

or

```bash
yarn add jotai
```

Then, import `jotai` in your React components and start managing your application's state.
