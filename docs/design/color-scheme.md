## Logo Description

"Create a modern logo for a search engine called 'Lemur' with the following specifications:

The logo features a stylized, minimalist magnifying glass as its core element. The handle of the magnifying glass is sleek and transforms into an abstract 'L' shape, creating a subtle nod to the name 'Lemur'. The circular lens portion contains a geometric pattern of connected nodes or circuits, suggesting AI intelligence and data connections.

The primary color is a rich deep purple (#5E17EB) with electric teal accents (#00D4C8), creating a vibrant contrast. The logo includes a subtle gradient from deep purple to lighter purple (#8556FF) giving it dimension and modern appeal.

The magnifying glass sits at a slight angle (about 30 degrees) to create dynamism. Inside the lens, bright teal circuit-like lines form a neural network pattern, symbolizing AI-powered search capabilities. The lines should be thin but clearly visible, connecting several small nodes.

The overall style is clean, geometric, and highly polished with minimal detailing – suitable for display at various sizes from favicons to large displays. The logo should appear futuristic and sophisticated without being overly complex, conveying both search functionality and artificial intelligence in a single unified design.

The logo should work well on both light and dark backgrounds and maintain its recognizability even at small sizes. The entire composition should be balanced and evoke a sense of discovery, precision, and intelligent technology."

## Typography Recommendation

- **Primary Font**: Sofia Pro or Proxima Nova for headings and UI elements
- **Secondary Font**: Inter or Open Sans for body text and search results
- **Monospace Font**: Fira Code for code snippets and technical information

This comprehensive color scheme and logo design creates a distinct brand identity for Lemur that differentiates it from competitors while conveying the intelligence, technology, and clarity that define the search engine's dual-format experience.
