   - Need more specific protocols for handling sensitive information in research queries.
   - Missing data retention policies for intermediate results.

5. **Integration with Current Search Infrastructure:**
   - Clearer transition path from current search architecture to multi-agent system.
   - Potential duplication of functionality between existing search services and new agent-based approach.

### 3.2 User Experience Gaps

1. **Progressive Disclosure of Complexity:**
   - Tool Page may overwhelm non-technical users with too many options.
   - Need for a tiered interface based on user expertise and subscription level.

2. **Results Visibility and Transparency:**
   - Users need visibility into which agents contributed to research results.
   - Mechanisms for explaining agent reasoning and source attribution need strengthening.

3. **Error Communication:**
   - Clear, user-friendly explanations of technical failures are missing.
   - Recovery options from failed multi-agent research need to be specified.

### 3.3 Documentation Gaps

1. **Agent Development Guide:**
   - Comprehensive guide for developing new agents is missing.
   - Templates and examples for common agent types would accelerate development.

2. **API Documentation for External Integration:**
   - External developer documentation for integrating third-party agents is incomplete.
   - Swagger/OpenAPI specifications for agent endpoints would be valuable.

3. **User-Facing Documentation:**
   - Tutorial content for the Tool Page is needed.
   - Documentation explaining the benefits of different agent combinations is missing.
