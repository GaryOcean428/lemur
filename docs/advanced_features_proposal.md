# Lemur Advanced Features: Tool Page, MCP, and A2A Protocols

This document outlines proposals for advanced features to enhance the Lemur application, specifically focusing on a dedicated Tool Page, a Multi-Agent Control Protocol (MCP), and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols. These features aim to improve Lemur's extensibility, user control over research processes, and the ability to perform more complex, collaborative research tasks using multiple specialized AI agents.

## 1. Tool Page

### 1.1. Concept and Purpose

The Tool Page will serve as a centralized hub for users to manage, configure, and interact with various research tools, data sources, and integrated AI agents within Lemur. It will empower users to customize their research environment and workflows.

### 1.2. Potential Features

*   **Tool/Agent Marketplace/Registry:** A browsable list of available tools, APIs (e.g., Tavily, Serper, specific academic databases), and specialized AI agents (e.g., a data extraction agent, a summarization agent, a hypothesis generation agent).
    *   Each entry would include a description, capabilities, configuration options, and an enable/disable toggle.
    *   Potential for users to add their own private API keys or even register custom tools/agents (advanced).
*   **Configuration Interface:** For each enabled tool/agent, users can set specific parameters. For example:
    *   Tavily: Default search depth, domains to include/exclude.
    *   Serper Google Scholar: Default number of results, specific journals to prioritize.
    *   Groq Model Selection: Preferred models for different tasks (synthesis, summarization, etc.), potentially overriding tier defaults if allowed.
*   **Workflow Builder (Advanced):** A visual interface or a simple scripting environment where users can chain multiple tools and agents together to create custom research workflows. For example, a workflow could be: "Perform Tavily web search -> Extract key entities -> For each entity, perform Google Scholar search -> Synthesize findings."
*   **Usage Monitoring & Limits:** Display usage statistics for different tools/APIs, especially those with cost implications or rate limits, integrated with the user's tier.
*   **Tool Presets/Templates:** Offer pre-configured sets of tools and settings for common research tasks (e.g., "Quick Fact Check," "In-depth Academic Review," "Market Analysis").

### 1.3. UI/UX Considerations

*   **Intuitive Navigation:** Clear categorization of tools and agents.
*   **User-Friendly Configuration:** Simple forms, toggles, and dropdowns for settings. Avoid overly technical jargon where possible.
*   **Responsive Design:** Ensure the page is accessible and usable across different devices.
*   **Feedback and Status Indicators:** Clear visual cues for enabled/disabled tools, successful configurations, or errors.

## 2. Multi-Agent Control Protocol (MCP)

### 2.1. Concept and Purpose

MCP will define how a primary controlling agent (or the Lemur backend acting as an orchestrator) manages and coordinates multiple specialized agents to achieve a complex research goal. It focuses on task decomposition, delegation, and result aggregation.

### 2.2. Key Protocol Elements

*   **Agent Registration & Discovery:** How specialized agents make themselves known to the orchestrator and declare their capabilities (e.g., "summarization_expert", "data_visualization_creator").
*   **Task Definition Language:** A standardized way to describe tasks that can be assigned to agents. This could be a JSON-based schema including input data, required output format, and constraints.
*   **Task Delegation & Assignment:** The orchestrator breaks down a user's high-level research query into sub-tasks and assigns them to appropriate agents based on their capabilities.
*   **State Management:** Tracking the status of each sub-task and the overall research project (e.g., pending, in-progress, completed, failed).
*   **Result Aggregation & Synthesis:** How results from different agents are collected, potentially transformed, and synthesized into a coherent final output for the user.
*   **Error Handling & Retry Mechanisms:** Standardized error reporting from agents and strategies for retrying failed tasks or re-assigning them.

## 3. Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication Protocols

### 3.1. Concept and Purpose

A2A protocols will govern direct communication and collaboration between individual specialized agents, allowing them to exchange information, request services from each other, or work in parallel on different facets of a problem without constant intervention from a central orchestrator (though the orchestrator might initiate such collaborations).

### 3.2. Key Protocol Elements

*   **Message Format:** A standardized message structure for A2A communication (e.g., using JSON or a more specialized format). This would include headers for sender/receiver ID, message type (request, response, notification), and a payload.
*   **Service Discovery:** How agents can find other agents that offer specific services they need (e.g., Agent A needs data cleaned, it queries a registry for an agent with "data_cleaning" capability).
*   **Interaction Patterns:** Defining common interaction patterns:
    *   **Request-Response:** One agent requests a service/information, another provides it.
    *   **Publish-Subscribe:** Agents can subscribe to specific topics or events published by other agents.
    *   **Collaborative Workflows:** Agents might pass partial results to each other in a predefined sequence.
*   **Shared Context/Memory (Optional but powerful):** A mechanism for agents working on a related task to access a shared understanding of the problem or a common data store (could be managed by Firestore or a similar backend service).
*   **Negotiation/Bidding (Advanced):** For tasks that multiple agents can perform, a protocol for them to negotiate or bid for the task.

## Next Steps for Implementation Planning

1.  **Prioritization:** Determine which aspects of the Tool Page, MCP, and A2A protocols offer the most immediate value and are feasible to implement first.
2.  **Detailed Design:** For prioritized features, create more detailed technical designs, including API specifications for agent interactions, database schema modifications, and UI mockups for the Tool Page.
3.  **Prototyping:** Develop proof-of-concept prototypes for key mechanisms, especially for agent communication and task delegation.
4.  **Iterative Implementation:** Build and integrate these features incrementally, with regular testing and user feedback.

This document serves as an initial proposal. Further refinement will be based on technical feasibility, development effort, and alignment with Lemur's overall product vision.
