# Comprehensive Codebase Issue Documentation

This PR addresses the requirement to identify and document all outstanding issues in the Lemur codebase. Each identified issue has been thoroughly documented with details including file path, line numbers, severity, description, and recommended resolution approach.

## Summary of Findings

A thorough review of the codebase has identified 14 distinct issues across several categories:

- **TypeScript Issues**: Type compatibility problems, particularly with Stripe API version definitions
- **API Errors and Error Handling**: Issues with Groq and Tavily API integrations, including inconsistent tool support and authentication failures
- **UI and Documentation Issues**: Documentation mismatches and missing architecture diagrams
- **Performance and Optimization Issues**: Timeout problems in deep research functionality and missing test coverage
- **Implementation Opportunities**: Incomplete multimodal search and subscription system features
- **Infrastructure Issues**: Insufficient monitoring and logging infrastructure

## Documentation Created

1. **`docs/codebase-issues.md`**: Comprehensive inventory of all identified issues with severity, file locations, code examples, and recommended resolutions
2. **`docs/issue-recommendations.md`**: Detailed recommendations for addressing each issue, including implementation strategies and prioritization

## Key Issues by Severity

### High Severity
- Groq API Tool Usage Issues - inconsistent tool support causing 500 errors
- Tavily API Authentication Issues - authentication failures in integrated search
- Error Handling for API Failures - inadequate handling for production environments

### Medium Severity
- TypeScript Compatibility Issues - particularly with Stripe API versions
- Citation Extraction Issues - problems extracting citations when tool calls fail
- Timeout Issues in Deep Research - performance problems during critique phase
- Missing Test Coverage - lack of tests for critical functionality
- Subscription System Incompleteness - unfinished Stripe integration

### Low Severity
- Documentation Mismatches - references to Python in TypeScript codebase
- Missing Architecture Diagrams - lack of visual system flow documentation
- Multimodal Search Gaps - incomplete voice and image search functionality

## Next Steps

Each identified issue should be created as a separate issue in the repository for tracking and resolution. The prioritization in the recommendations document can guide the order of addressing these issues.

The high-severity issues should be addressed first as they impact core functionality of the Lemur application, particularly around search capabilities and API integrations.

Fixes #17.
