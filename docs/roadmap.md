- [ ] Add graceful fallback when either Tavily or Groq services are unavailable
- [ ] Create a monitoring dashboard for API performance and error rates

### 2. Search Experience Enhancements

- [ ] Improve contextual follow-up detection with more sophisticated pattern matching
- [ ] Add visual indicators for different result types (news, academic, etc.)
- [ ] Implement sorting/filtering options for traditional search results

### 3. Performance Optimization

- [ ] Implement client-side caching for frequent searches
- [ ] Optimize image loading in search results
- [ ] Add progressive loading for search results

## Medium-term Goals (2-6 Months)

### 1. Advanced AI Integration

- [ ] Explore direct Groq Compound Beta integration to leverage built-in Tavily search
