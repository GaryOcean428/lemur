# Lemure Roadmap

## Current Status (May 2025)

Lemure is a sophisticated AI-powered search platform that combines traditional search results with AI-synthesized answers. The system currently features:

- Dual search results (traditional web results and AI-generated answers)
- Tiered subscription model with different capabilities for each tier
- User authentication and session management
- Customizable search preferences
- Contextual follow-up capabilities
- Integration with Groq Compound Beta for AI answers
- Integration with Tavily for web search results

## Immediate Priorities (Next 2 Weeks)

### 1. Core Search & Result Display

- [x] Fix traditional search results not appearing alongside AI answers
- [ ] Ensure proper citation of sources in AI responses
- [ ] Fix error handling for Groq API failures, especially around tool usage
- [ ] Improve handling of rate limits and API timeouts

## Short-term Improvements (Next 4 Weeks)

### 1. Error Handling and Reliability

- [ ] Implement more robust error handling for Groq API failures
- [ ] Add graceful fallback when either Tavily or Groq services are unavailable
- [ ] Create a monitoring dashboard for API performance and error rates
- [ ] Add proper logging and telemetry for debugging production issues

### 2. Search Experience Enhancements

- [x] Improve contextual follow-up with dedicated UI elements
- [ ] Add visual indicators for different result types (news, academic, etc.)
- [ ] Implement sorting/filtering options for traditional search results
- [ ] Optimize answer formatting with better markdown rendering

### 3. Performance Optimization

- [ ] Implement client-side caching for frequent searches
- [ ] Optimize image loading in search results
- [ ] Add progressive loading for search results
- [ ] Implement server-side caching strategies for API responses

## Medium-term Goals (2-6 Months)

### 1. Advanced AI Integration

- [x] Implement direct Groq Compound Beta integration to leverage built-in search capabilities
- [ ] Add support for deep research capability using agentic loops (following sub-queries)
- [ ] Complete multimodal search capabilities (image and voice input)
- [ ] Implement feature parity across all search modes

### 2. User Experience Improvements

- [ ] Redesign mobile experience with better touch interaction
- [ ] Add customizable themes and accessibility options
- [ ] Complete search history with saved searches functionality
- [ ] Add visual diagrams to documentation for clearer architecture understanding

### 3. Content & Data Improvements

- [ ] Expand source filtering options beyond geographic region
- [ ] Add domain reputation scoring to prioritize trustworthy sources
- [ ] Implement content categorization for better organization of results
- [ ] Add automated testing for key user flows and API integrations

## Long-term Vision (6+ Months)

### 1. Advanced Capabilities

- [ ] Develop custom reasoning layers on top of LLM answers
- [ ] Implement cross-session learning (with user opt-in)
- [ ] Add support for domain-specific search modes (medical, legal, technical)
- [ ] Implement Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) connectivity

### 2. Ecosystem Expansion

- [ ] Build browser extensions for Lemure integration
- [ ] Create robust API endpoints for third-party developers
- [ ] Implement federated authentication options
- [ ] Create documentation portal for developers and API users

### 3. Enterprise Features

- [ ] Add organization accounts with team-based access control
- [ ] Implement private knowledge base integration
- [ ] Add compliance and audit features for regulated industries
- [ ] Build Docker containerization for easier enterprise deployment

## Ongoing Priorities

- Maintaining high level of data privacy and security
- Ensuring factual accuracy in AI responses
- Optimizing infrastructure costs while maintaining performance
- Regular updates to AI models and search algorithms
