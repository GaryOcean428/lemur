# Groq API Error Handling Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the Groq API integration in the Lemur application, focusing on error handling, fallback mechanisms, and maintaining consistent model usage.

## Current Model Constraints

- **Primary models**: compound-beta and compound-beta-mini via Groq (using Llama 4 and Llama 3.3 70b)
- **Secondary models**: GPT-4.1 and mini variants for specific use cases

## Tool Usage Improvements

### Issues Identified

1. **Tool API Instability**: The Groq API tool support has been inconsistent, sometimes failing with 500 errors.
2. **Inconsistent Response Format**: When tool calls succeed, the `executed_tools` format can vary.
3. **Citation Extraction Failure**: When tools fail, citations are not properly extracted from the response.

### Solutions Implemented

1. **Enhanced Error Detection**:
   - Added JSON error parsing for better error message extraction
   - Implemented specific detection for tool-related errors
   - Added error metadata to make error types more easily identifiable

2. **Automatic Fallback Mechanism**:
   - When a tool-related error is detected, automatically retry without tools
   - Maintain citation extraction from the fallback response
   - Preserve context and preserve the user experience despite the error

3. **Improved Logging**:
   - Added detailed logging of tool support status for each model
   - Tracked which models have experienced tool errors for future improvement

## Responses API Usage for GPT-4.1

For GPT-4.1 models, we've ensured that we use the appropriate Responses API to match the latest OpenAI requirements. This approach ensures:

1. **Proper Token Usage**: By using the Responses API properly, we avoid unnecessary token consumption
2. **Future Compatibility**: Following the official API guidelines ensures compatibility with future updates
3. **Result Consistency**: Standardized approach across different models for consistent response formatting

## Additional Error Cases Handled

1. **Service Unavailability (503)**: Improved messaging and logging for service outages
2. **Rate Limiting (429)**: Enhanced handling with clear user-facing messages
3. **Authentication Errors (401)**: Better guidance for API key issues
4. **Model Not Found (404)**: Specific handling for incorrect model references

## Future Improvements

1. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Implement a circuit breaker to temporarily disable tool usage after multiple failures
2. **Model Capability Learning**: Track tool support across models and dynamically adjust based on success rates
3. **Retry Strategy**: Implement exponential backoff for retries on transient errors
4. **Error Telemetry**: Add structured logging of error types for easier monitoring

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Simulated Errors**: Create tests that simulate different error responses from the API
2. **Response Validation**: Verify that responses maintain expected formats even when fallbacks are triggered
3. **Edge Cases**: Test with various model combinations and query types
4. **Load Testing**: Verify that error handling remains robust under high load
